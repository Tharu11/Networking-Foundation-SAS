Possible Answer Sheet
 


Q1 What do you mean by “TOPOLOGY”?
A. The layout of how a network communicates with different devices is called a “TOPOLOGY”.
	
Q2 Name the most common Topology?
A. The most common Topology is the “Star Topology”.
	
Q3 In ___________ topology the computers are connected to the central wiring point such as a Hub or a Switch.
A. A Star Topology
	
Q4 data on Star Network  passes through the _________ point before continuing to its destination.
A. The central point.
	
Q5The major benefits of Star  topology is that if  one computer failed or if there was a break in a cable the other computers will  not be affected. Why?
A. The major benefits of this topology is that if there is one computer failed or if there was a break in a cable the other computers would not be affected because each computer has their own cable connection.


Q6 Major disadvantage of a star topology is that if the central hub or switch fails, the other computers on that central point would be affected and this is called a ?
A. A “Single Point of Failure”.
	
Q7 What happens if we have Single Point of Failure?
A. If we have a Single Point of Failure the entire network goes down.
	
Q8 Name the network topology where  computer devices and network devices are connected to a single cable? 
A. The network topology where computer devices and network devices are connected to a single cable are Bus Topology which is very old technology and it is not used today that much.
	
Q9 Backbone of Bus Topology is known as?
A. Backbone of Bus Topology is known as “Coaxial Cable”.
	
Q10 In Bus Topology, the  computers are connected with this cable using special connectors called BNC which are also known as ?
A. In Bus Topology, the  computers are connected with this cable using special connectors called BNC which are also known as T-Connectors.
	
Q11 One of the advantages of the bus topology is ?
A. One of the advantages of the bus topology is that it is very cheap and easy to implement.
	
Q12 However the disadvantage of the bus topology is that it requires that the cable be terminated at both ends using ?
A. The disadvantage of the bus topology is that it requires that the cable be terminated at both ends using terminators.
	
Q13 If a computer is removed or added or if terminators are loose or missing then the cable would be open and data will bounce back and this is known as ? 
A. If a computer is removed or added or if terminators are loose or missing then the cable would be open and data will bounce back and this is known as single-reflection.
	
Q14 What happens if we have signal-reflection?
A. If we have single-reflection the dataflow would be disrupted.
	
Q15 Name the type of network configuration where each computer is connected to each other and shaped of a closed loop or ring so every computer on this ring has exactly two neighbors
A. The ring topology is the type of network configuration where each computer is connected to each other and shaped of a closed loop or ring so every computer on this ring has exactly two neighbors.
	
Q16 The advantage of ring topology is that it is easy to ?
A. The advantage of ring topology is that it is easy to install and easy to troubleshoot.
	
Q17 The dis-advantage of ring topology ?
A. The disadvantage of ring topology is that just one of these computers goes down or if there was a single break in the cable then all data flow would be disrupted.
	
Q18 Name a network setup where each computer and network device is interconnected with one another?
A. A Mesh Topology is a network setup where each computer and network device is interconnected with one another.
	
Q19 In Mesh Topology each computer on the network connects to every other computer on the network so by having so many connections it handles_____ very well.
A. It handles failure very well.
	
Q20 Mesh Topology  setup allows for most transmissions to be distributed even if ___ of the connections goes down. 
A. If one of the connections goes down.
	
Q21 Mesh Topology  is  commonly used for?
A. Mesh Topology is commonly used for wireless networks.
	
Q22 Mesh Topology can be expensive due to ?
A. Mesh Topology can be expensive due to the amount of cabling and network cards that have to be used.
	
Q23 Due to expensive Mesh Topology is rarely used in _________ Area Network.
A. In the Local Area Network.
	
Q24 Mesh Topology is mainly used in _______ Area Network.
A. In Wide Area Network.
	
Q25 Name a perfect example of Mesh Topology?
A. A perfect example of Mesh Topology is the Internet.
	
Q26 The advantage of Mesh Topology is it creates a ?
A. The advantage of Mesh Topology is it creates a high redundancy level because if one or more connections fails the computer will still be able to communicate with each other.
	
Q27 Will computers still be able to communicate In Mesh Topology what happens if One or more connections fail? (YES /NO)
A. Yes.
	
Q28 Topologies can also be combined with other topologies if needed and these were known as ?
A. Topologies can also be combined with other topologies if needed and its known as Hybrid Topology.
	
Q29. Name the  most common form of hybrid topologies 
A. The most common form of hybrid topologies are Star ring network and Star bus network.
	
Q30 In a Star Bus network ________ star topologies linked together using a single cable bus connection.
A. Two or more star topologies.
	
Q31 In a Star Ring network_________ring networks are linked together to form a large link network.  
A. Two or more ring networks.
	
Q32 In Point to Point Topology are two hosts that are directly connected to each other using______.
A. A Single Cable.
	
Q33 These hosts could be____?
A. Computers, switches, routers, servers and so on.
	
Q34 In A Client Server Topology  clients connect directly to a ____________to access resources rather than connecting to each other.
A. Directly to a centralized server to access.
	
Q35 Why do a lot of businesses use this Client Server  topology?
A. A lot of businesses use the Client Server Topology because instead of having to pull all the resources on each computer which is a lot more work.
